# Introduction

Pyp-boy is a text-RPG written in Python using Flask that will make you explore a region of the Wasteland with its mysteries and dangers.

This application was born from a first idea, I've wanted to make a pip-boy on Pinephone. However, the more I've progressed, the more I've preferred to switch to this mode.

The application can be run locally using Python or the Container image. Please check the [installation](install.md) instructions for more.
