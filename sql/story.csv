1,1,1,"You wake up with a start after having the contents of a ice water bucket thrown in your face. ""Where am I? What's going on?"". The questions loop around in your head confused by the rude awakening. Beginning to regain some lucidity, you then notice with amazement that you are sitting on the ground, your hands tied behind your back. As you look up, you see the man who just threw the bucket of water at you.

""Where's your camp?"" the man in front of you asked, shouting as if he thought you were deaf. 

""Camp, camp, camp..."" that word echoes in your head still panicked and alert. The sharp pain at the base of your skull lets you know that you have not been roused from your sleep but taken away by force after being violently knocked out. This guy wants to know the location of the camp where you recently found refuge and were taken in when you were in bad shape.",1,5,3,2,img:basement.jpg,0,You give the guy what he wants,You try to stand up to the interrogation and refuse to give information,You say nothing and look around for an escape plan,100,apparel:1;apparel:2
2,1,2,"You observe the place you are in. It seems to be some kind of cellar in the basement of a ruined house. There are small windows at the top of the walls, most of them broken, which could allow you to escape through them. There are quite a few tools also lying around on the floor or on a table that seems to serve as a makeshift workbench. You make a quick inventory of what your confused look manages to identify: hammers, screwdrivers, ropes, chains, and ... A body lying on a mattress at the back of the room.

Obviously, your captors are no joke and either the guy at the back was less lucky, or he was already pretty beat up because even a ghoul looks better than what would appear to be the remains of his face.

""Are you deaf or something? I asked you where your camp is!""

Your interrogator becomes more and more urgent, as if he is under pressure to get results as soon as possible. He then grabs some kind of crowbar and brandishes it with a threatening look. You don't really want to end up like the one who seems to have been your predecessor.",1,5,3,,img:basement.jpg,0,You try to lie about the location of the camp,You refuse to answer,,100,
3,1,3,"""What camp?"" you answer your attacker. You refuse to tell him anything about the last place you took refuge. Rusty Springs took you in while you were injured and being chased under circumstances you no longer remember.

""Don't fuck with me!"" the interrogator yelled, sputtering. For a moment, you have a doubt between whether sitting on the floor of this basement, hearing this guy scream, smelling his putrid odor, or his spitting is the most unpleasant.

But this was not the time for such trivial questions, especially when the gorilla in front of you grabs some kind of crowbar and brandishes it in front of you with a threatening look.

He approaches once again and gives you a violent kick in the legs.

""I'm asking you one last time nicely. Where is your camp?""

You need to think fast, because the next summons might be with that metal rod.",1,5,4,,img:basement.jpg,0,You lie about the camp,You insist on refusing to answer,,0,
4,1,4,"The screaming gorilla backs up and starts pacing back and forth in the small cellar where you are standing. He paces back and forth in front of you as he rasps the crowbar on the floor.

""OK I see, so you intend to be of no use to us. All you have to do is tell us which camp you are from. We know there's one around here with enough resources to get through the coming winter.""

He turns around one last time in front of you and looks down on you. Your head is screaming in pain and still feeling the blow that brought you here, and your legs have joined the concert. For a moment, you feel a sense of relief just before you are hit hard in the head with the metal bar.

You collapse to the ground, your eyesight turns red, and you close your eyes thinking ""world of crap"". Still slightly conscious, you hear what seems to be a sudden huge crash and screams of panic, or is it your head injury that makes you imagine all this? 

Your last questions will remain unanswered as you lose consciousness.

You are dead.",1,,,,img:basement.jpg,1,,,,0,
5,1,5,"Rusty Springs took you in while you were wounded and being chased by assailants. You don't really remember all the details, but the warmth of the camp at a time when it was everyone for themselves made an impression on you.

So you hesitate to betray those who helped you in your time of need.

Still confused and totally unaware of your current location, you mutter something about a camp called Blightwoods, southeast of a Red Rocket station.

""Blightwoods? I don't know about that... Do you think I'm a fool ?""

Unconvinced by your answer, he grabs some kind of crowbar and starts threatening you with it.

""Now you're going to tell me where your camp is, unless you want to end up like him.

The assailant points to a lying body that looks like it has been beaten up so badly that there is not much left to identify. Your assailant's insistence becomes more and more pressing, as if he himself were under pressure.",1,7,6,,img:basement.jpg,0,You maintain your story,You look around looking for a way out,,100,

It appears that you are in some sort of basement of a ruined house. There are small windows at the top of the walls, most of which are broken, which could allow you to escape through them. There are also a lot of tools lying around on the floor or on a table that seems to serve as a makeshift workbench. You make a quick inventory of what your confused eyes manage to identify: hammers, screwdrivers, ropes, chains, etc.

""So you're going to answer me... FUCK!""

Your assailant is interrupted in his threatening tirade by a huge booming sound from outside. Screams of panic are heard from upstairs and your captor's acolytes seem to be running around as if preparing for an attack.

With your hands tied behind your back, you feel somewhat helpless. But your interrogator having slackened his attention on you for a moment, you then notice the presence of a knife on the table in front of you.",1,8,,,img:basement.jpg,0,Next,,,100,

It would be built on the ruins of what seems to have been a small residential area of an ancient town, since ravaged by the nuclear strikes that have brought the world to the state as we know it.

Still not convinced, the aggressor loses patience and presses you more and more.

""Your story doesn't hold water, you're kidding me. You're going to tell me where your camp is really located otherwise this bar will be in your face!""

He brandished his crowbar again and was about to hit you in the legs with a heavy blow when suddenly a huge racket sounded from outside with wall-crushing roars and explosions.

""Damn they are here!!!"", exclaimed the gorilla.

You hear panicked screams upstairs, orders being shouted, people running around as if preparing for an attack. They are surely the acolytes of your captor. 

You take advantage of the sudden panic and, above all, that the attention on you has been diverted, to form an escape plan. You think of the knife on the table in front of you to cut your bonds and escape.",1,8,,,img:basement.jpg,0,Next,,,100,
8,1,8,"Like a bolt of lightning, a reddish flash of light spontaneously illuminated the cellar where you and your captor are standing. Screams could be heard on the upper floor. Not the disorganized screams of soldiers preparing for an assault, but screams of terror. 

""FUCK!"" your captor shouted. The gorilla was no longer interested in talking to you or even turning your head into scrambled eggs. Panic-stricken, he left the room in which you are, leaving you alone and abandoned to your fate in a bewildering din of roars, screams and red lightning.

You take advantage of this situation to get up and go and get the knife which is on the table in front of you. You manage as well as you can to cut the string which tied your wrists, you are finally free of your movements. Gradually coming to your senses, a flash of lucidity strikes you: ""... my gun!""

You look around the room, but you can't find your weapon or your ammunition. Your captors must have stolen them or left them where they took you. The only things that could be weapons that you find in the rush are the knife that was used to free you, and the crowbar that only minutes before threatened to become one with your head.

You take these objects with you and try to escape.",1,9,12,,img:basement.jpg,0,You go out the door,You go out the window,,100,weapon:1;weapon:2

10,1,10,"It is not without a certain irony that you brandish the crowbar and smash the skull of your captor. The gorilla falls and lies on the ground, what is left of its head covered with blood.

You can't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at seeing the roles reversed, but you won't enjoy this sick victory for too long.

At the top of the stairs leading to the cellar where you stand, you hear the voices of your captor's sidekicks.

""Boss! Boss! Where are you! They're here, we have to get out of here!""

Not feeling up to confronting a whole bunch of raiders, you opt to escape through the window after all.",1,12,,,img:basement.jpg,0,Next,,,100,
11,1,11,"In spite of your state, you manage to jump back like a deer and you dodge the hook that your captor was about to address you. 

Mad with rage, he launches himself towards you and you brandish the crowbar hoping to knock him down. Suddenly, the gorilla is stopped dead in his tracks, hit by a red beam identical to those that flash outside. With a smoking hole located in the place of what used to be his abdomen, the man collapses to the ground.

""Oh this sucks"" you suddenly say to yourself. The door wasn't really a good idea, you turn to the window.",1,12,,,img:basement.jpg,0,Next,,,100,

As you struggle to get out with relative grace, you hear from the basement one of your captor's henchmen yelling. 

""BOSS! BOSS! They got the boss!""

You briefly look out the window to see if the guy saw you, hoping he won't follow you, but he's suddenly charred by a fiery red flash. You jump back after witnessing this scene. You manage to hide behind a bush and you hear the confused noises and screams. 

Robots, they are robots attacking your captors' lair. Who is controlling them? You don't know. Would they be friendly to you? It's best not to find out right away.

Luckily, and to your surprise, Rusty Springs is about ten kilometers northeast of your location. How could your captors have missed its location? They must not have looked very hard or they only recently learned of its existence. Although you've spent little time there, you quickly notice that Rusty Springs is a very discreet camp.

A metallic, robotic noise startles you. Have the robots found you yet?

You don't hear a thudding, cadenced footstep like you did during the assault you escaped from. Only a robotic noise that seems to be isolated. A machine that has lost its group? is it hostile? damaged? hopefully harmless?

This could be an opportunity to find out a little more about these robot raiders who attacked your captors.

The sound gets louder and louder and is located behind a tree. You seem to notice a pile of scrap metal on the ground and continue to approach. A robot arm that has lost its body is lying in front of you. You look up and see that the rest of the body is scattered around. It was indeed a robot, completely demolished. 

The observation of the debris leaves you a bit puzzled because you notice that the carcass does not resemble any other kind of robot you have ever known. Not a Protectron, not a Sentinel and certainly not an Assaultron, this type of machine seems unknown to you.

The head of the machine, perhaps the only part still somewhat attached to the rest of the body scattered here and there, is at the origin of the metallic sizzling sound you heard.

In your current state, fighting guards or raiders would end the same way in either case. You stop your painful walk and raise your arms in surrender.

A man emerges from a hunter's hideout and approaches while holding you at gunpoint. Your eyesight, blurred by fatigue and disorientation, does not allow you to identify him.

""Wait, I've seen you around before... you wouldn't be... ?""

You don't have time to listen or even respond. The physical and mental exhaustion comes to an end of the last forces that it remained to you and you collapse on the ground.",3,4,,,img:wasteland-forrest.png,0,Next,,,100,

You wonder if he is a Rusty Springs guard or a raider. Mind you, a raider probably wouldn't have warned you.

Images, sounds, smells come together in a delirium where, barely conscious, you think you hear and see things.

""AH!"" you scream.

You suddenly wake up, drenched in sweat, lying on a mattress on the floor. You quickly feel that your hands are tied. As you think to yourself that this is starting to become a habit, you also notice that you are shirtless with bandages where your injuries are.

Unlike the previous time, the people holding you prisoner seem to be less nefarious.

You observe the room where you are located and it seems familiar. You note the presence of rudimentary medical equipment and a bed near an opaque window.

The footsteps get closer and you hear a muffled conversation between two women.

""How is he?"" the first one asked in a confident tone.
""In bad shape but he'll survive. You can come in,"" the second voice replies.

The door opens and you hear a person enter the room. This one seems to stop midway for a few long seconds. You feel your heart racing.

""It's okay Sleeping Beauty, stop pretending, we heard you screaming five minutes ago"".

""What the hell,"" you think as you feel your face redden with embarrassment.

You roll over on the mattress and look up at the woman standing in front of you and crouch down to get to your level.

""You look really bad,"" she throws out with an amused look.

Your face lights up and a big smile shows your relief. You recognize Sonja, the leader of Rusty Springs, the one who took you in some time before under rather similar conditions.

""You should see the other guy,"" you say in a reassuring tone, before coughing and writhing in pain while laughing.",3,8,,,img:medical-room.png,0,Next,,,100,

Despite your bound hands, you try to get into position to pounce on the first person to burst into the room. Your heart is beating like never.

The door opens and a woman confidently enters the room. You leap but your run stops halfway because the belt of your pants is itself attached to a rope you hadn't noticed. Your momentum stopped dead in your tracks, you crash to the floor.

""Jerk,"" the woman says in an amused tone while turning you around with a gentle kick.

Your ego seems to have suffered more than your body this time. Red with embarrassment, you look up and recognize Sonja, the head of Rusty Springs.

""It's getting to be a habit for you to show up at my house half dead,"" Sonja observed.

""How is he?"" the first asked in a confident tone.

You sit down as best you can on the mattress and stare at the door of the room. When it opens, a tall woman enters the room.

""You look like hell,"" she says.

""You should see the other guy,"" you reply with an amused and reassured look on your face with a huge smile lighting up your face.

Being reassured is a luxury that is difficult to enjoy in the Wasteland. But this time you can because your interlocutor is none other than Sonja, the chief of Rusty Springs. The same one who had welcomed you some time before in a more or less similar situation.

""It's getting to be a habit to show up at my house half-dead,"" she answered while putting your good old coat on your shoulders.

""Guess so,"" you reply in a slightly embarrassed tone.",3,8,,,img:medical-room.png,0,Next,,,100,
28,3,8,"""I'm sorry about the tied hands. The guards didn't recognize you and didn't want to take any chances,"" Sonja said as she cut the rope that bound your wrists. She couldn't help but notice that your hands bore more previous marks.

You then explained your recent misadventures to Sonja, the raiders' lair that captured you, the robot attack and your escape. When she asked you how you were captured, you realize you are unable to answer.

""With what you took on your head, it's normal that you don't remember everything that happened to you recently"". This wise explanation comes from Iren, the Rusty Springs doctor who attended to your injuries... Again. This one approaches you and changes your bandages.

""You left about ten days ago saying you had to continue your mission. We didn't know what happened to you,"" Sonja continues.

""The mission,"" you suddenly think. You hear the word, you understand what it means, but you are immediately unable to associate it with yourself. If you had a ""mission"", for the moment, you do not remember what it is.

Seeing your blank, troubled look, Sonja understands that something is wrong.

""I'd like to help you, but you never told us anything about it. And since it's none of our business, I didn't want to know about it,"" she says in a calm tone. ""But I think it will come back to you before long,"" she continued, wanting to reassure you.

The tranquility of your reunion seemed to be short-lived.",3,9,,,img:medical-room.png,0,Next,,,100,
29,3,9,"Catching his breath, the guard gradually regains his composure and explains the situation. 

""We came across a merchant during a patrol who seemed worried and rushed. Upon asking him what happened, he told us that Midwich Valley was completely razed, burned to the ground even.""

Midwich Valley is the closest thing to a town as far as the Wasteland can conceive it. It is a camp, located about thirty kilometers from Rusty Springs, where over a hundred people live, not counting the itinerant merchants and other slightly less approachable oddballs.

A place so frequented and populated cannot have been destroyed so easily. Not to mention that it was a city with good fortifications because it was regularly targeted by raiders and even Super Mutants.",3,10,14,,img:medical-room.png,0,You ask where the merchant is located,You think it's not your problem,,100,
30,3,10,"""Where is that merchant?"" you suddenly ask the guard. He gives you a sideways glance and doesn't really want to answer.

If mistrust of others is probably the most common sentiment in the Wasteland, Rusty Springs has made it a real culture in addition to its sense of discretion. It may seem inhospitable to outsiders, but this rigidity has allowed this village to continue to be almost unknown deep in its forest and thus avoid being targeted by raiders. When the guards are on patrol, they pretend to be wanderers who roam the Wasteland with no real purpose. While to an outsider their patrol cycle seems very random, it is actually well calculated to avoid arousing suspicion.

""You can tell him,"" Sonja answered the guard.

""He was set up in a clearing five kilometers to the northeast,"" the guard continued. He went on to say that the merchant intended to stay a few days to rest his brahmin. 

The guard points out the location on the map of your Pip-boy. After exchanging a glance with Sonja, she understands that you intend to go and meet this merchant. However, you are still too weak to leave the village, you still need to rest.",3,11,,,img:medical-room.png,0,Next,,,100,

Your body is still sore, but less so than the day before and the stimpack Iren injected you with is working wonders. After getting dressed and taking your stuff, you go to see Iren and Sonja to inform them that you have to go and see this merchant.

You pass the guard who accompanies you towards the exit of the village. This is one of the advantages of Rusty Springs. The village is built in the middle of such a dense forest that it is almost invisible from the outside. Palisades of vegetation provide additional camouflage that further hides the location. The only way to enter is through well guarded underground tunnels scattered all over the place. They allow you to enter and leave the village at a good distance from it.

The guard accompanies you along one of these tunnels and then points you in the direction of the clearing where the merchant has set up shop temporarily.

After a little less than an hour's walk, you reach the location and go to meet the merchant.",3,12,,,img:medical-room.png,0,Next,,,100,
32,3,12,"You pass in a nonchalant way in front of the merchant and this one calls you. 

""Hey, I have some good cheap stuff, do you want to buy it?""

""Why not"", you answer him with a moderately convinced air. ""I didn't expect to meet a merchant in this hole"", you continue.

""But I don't work here. I'm just passing through but Germaine and Maryse have to rest"", he says pointing to his brahmin. The two heads of the mutant animal stare at him in a way that could be considered embarrassing.

As you look at the merchant's inventory, you take the opportunity to start questioning him about your real intentions.

""Tell me, do you have any idea of the fastest way to Midwich Valley? My pip-boy's map is unable to tell me anything.""

Just by saying the name ""Midwich Valley"", you had the impression to have invoked a kind of taboo which made your interlocutor blush.

""Ah but ... in fact ... Midwich ... There's no more. Crammed, razed, destroyed, only debris and cadavers,"" he said with a trembling voice. ""I've seen camps looted by Super Mutants before, but not a butchery like this, nothing left but smoking corpses.""

You feign a revolted look mixing surprise and disgust with an acting skill that amazes yourself.

""I hope there are no people you knew there,"" the merchant muttered, hoping to cheer you up. You tell him no, you were simply planning to go there to do business.

As you look around the merchant's bazaar, you notice a rusty and badly damaged robotic hand that seems to remind you of something.",3,13,,,img:merchant.png,0,How much for the robot part?,,,100,
33,3,13,"""This? say 20 caps will do?"" the merchant asked. After the discussion about Midwich Valley, the naturalness came back to him. You try to haggle a little about the price, which seems quite high to you, while feeling curiously attracted by this robotic debris, which is at first glance useless.

""Aah you're tough on business... Well ok go for 15"", capitulated the merchant after a few long minutes of negotiation during which you agreed to take some extra ammunition.

With both parties satisfied with their transaction, you eventually continue on your way back to the rendezvous point you had set with the Rusty Springs guard. On the way back, you observe the robotic hand from every joint, as if trying to unravel an ancient mystery.

Very damaged, this one seems to have been burned, but you distinguish some characters written in the palm. 

""SN..R...V..27-..78""

With a little scraping of the encrusted grime on the inscription, you manage to see a little more.

""SN...R...V127-M78""

Suddenly, you stop dead in your tracks.

""127!!!"" you shout as if having discovered the answer to the ultimate question. A bolt of lightning seems to have flashed through your mind as you read this half-covered, dirt-erased inscription.

You hurry to your meeting point, as if taken by a sudden euphoria.

Accompanied by the guard, you notice that a faint indicator light has started to flash on your Pip-boy. A symbol indicating to read a Holotape flashes on the screen.

You wait until you find a quiet corner to read it.

Besides, while you're still itching to find out what happened to this town, you don't feel up to going on another adventure yet.

For now, your priority is to recover from your kidnapping and remember your mission. You have alerted Sonja about the robots that attacked the raider camp that kidnapped you, and you offer to assist her if Rusty Springs is ever in danger.

The next day, after what seems like the first night's sleep in ages, you decide to take a walk through Rusty Springs to stock up on weapons and ammunition.

You spend the few Caps you had and feel a little less naked now that you've picked up a weapon and ammo. As you inspect your new acquisition, you notice a faint yellow light flashing on your Pip-boy.

36,3,16,"You feel yourself turning pale as you read this document. You have been reminded of your mission, and the lost connections in your head are slowly being rebuilt. You remember your encounter with a Brotherhood's Elder a few months ago. You've been in trouble before for your meddling skills, but this time you've gone a little too far and have drawn the wrath of one of the factions you don't want to be angry with.

However, to your surprise, the Elder did not have you imprisoned or executed but saw you as an asset. Your unpredictability and ability to find hidden secrets are matched only by your ability to get into and out of impossible situations. And that, the Elder seems to have seen in you and offered you a deal. Find the location of a Vault whose coordinates have been lost and discover what's inside.

If you succeed, you will be pardoned and considered an ally of the Brotherhood. If not, you will be executed for attempting to steal its secrets.

You don't remember thinking much about it at the time and quickly accepted the mission without even knowing all the details. The last thing you remember is being dropped into the wilderness from a Vertibird by Squires who thought they were releasing a civilian who had no business being there. They didn't know that you had been promoted in the greatest secrecy by the Elder as a Sentinel of the Brotherhood, granting you complete autonomy to accomplish your mission at the cost of absolute discretion.

You wonder what you're going to do.",3,17,,,img:brotherhood.png,0,Next,,,100,
37,3,17,"That night, you didn't sleep so well. Being on the verge of death seems to be a better way for you to sleep than being a Sentinel of the Brotherhood on a mission. You've turned the situation over in your head to try to find a way out that won't endanger Rusty Springs, but you'll have to keep investigating. With Midwich Valley burned to the ground, you'll have to find another populated town to investigate.

But first, you decide to go see Sonja and inform her of your recent discovery.

""I would never have imagined that you were one of those fanatics,"" Sonja threw out in an inquisitive tone.

""Neither did I,"" you reply with a forced smile. You explain as well as you can the situation while making some lies by omission, in particular on the passages indicating not to speak about it to anybody and to remove any possible threat. You only give Sonja the bare essentials, telling her that you are a mercenary on a mission for the Brotherhood. You reassure her that you will continue to keep the location of the village secret and that it has no connection with your objective.

Despite Sonja's sympathetic attitude, her natural distrust quickly returns and she promises you many unpleasant things should the safety of Rusty Spring be compromised. To show your good faith, you show your Pip-boy's map: the location where they are is not marked with any campsite, only a forest. You have managed to delete the information about this place.

You thank Sonja one last time for helping you twice, and decide to leave Rusty Springs the next morning.",4,1,,,img:rusty-springs.png,0,Next,,,100,
