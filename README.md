# Pyp-Boy

Pyp-boy is a Python Flask-based text role playing game inspired by the *Fallout* lore. At the beginning of this project, the idea was to make a quick and dirty attempt to create a pip-boy for the Pinephone, but the more the development advanced, the more I've shifted to this idea.

## Warning

This game is still under development.

So far, the story is 4 chapters long. They've all been translated in English.

## Documentation

Please read the [documentation](docs/README.md) for installation and startup instructions.

## Roadmap

- Being able to support multiple languages for a story
- The story does not takes account in the character's selected gender yet, it would be nice to implement it later.
- The MAP tab is intended to display the various discovered locations using OSM as a background. It will try to create a fictional map using actual ones.
- Add a better management for the data save, possibility to delete one entry.
- The STAT tab could display character's informations and maybe introducing the *Fallout*'s iconic SPECIAL system, only for cosmetic purpose since there is no actual gameplay.
- Support multiple databases
